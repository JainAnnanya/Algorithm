# Algorithm

This course provided me with a deep dive into algorithms, offering a practical understanding. 

I delved into algorithm analysis, mastering big O, Theta, and Omega notations to gauge efficiency. From graph algorithms like DFS, BFS, and MST to sorting techniques, hands-on projects kept me engaged. Building B-trees, and AVL trees, and tackling numerical algorithms like the Karatsuba algorithm enriched my skill set. 

I refined my problem-solving skills and knowledge through designing techniques like greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, hashing in real-world applications and coding challenges in C++.
